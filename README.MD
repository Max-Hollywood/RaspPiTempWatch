Hi, the script will display in console and write the current Raspberry Pi temperature to a file.  You probably need you to change the owner or set executable permissions to run.

```bash
sudo chown USER temperature.sh

sudo chmod +x temperature.sh

./temperature.sh
OR
./temperature.sh &
```

Delete/comment the lines, change some things, have some fun with it, do whatever you want.

References are listed in the script file.

As with all scripts you find, read them yourself before executing them.
